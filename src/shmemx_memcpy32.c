/*
 * This routine handles aligned memory copying of 32-bit aligned data in a high
 * performance manner. If the src and desination arrays have offsets but are
 * dword aligned at some point, the routine copies the initial offset amounts,
 * performs dword copies in the middle, and then copies the remaining elements.
 * If the arrays are misaligned, it performs a slow copy.
 * -JAR
 *
 * Register Key:
 *  r0  = dst, destination pointer
 *  r1  = src, source pointer which we copy and then use as remainder
 *  r2  = nelem, number of elements and temporary register
 *  r3  = temporary register
 *  r16 = r16-r17 used as dword src data
 *  r18 = r18-r19 used as dword src data
 *  r20 = r20-r21 used as dword src data
 *  r22 = r22-r23 used as dword src data
 *  r24 = store the src here to free up r1 for 16-bit instructions
